# Age-Calculator
A JavaScript-based age calculator web application that computes a person's age based on their birthdate and displays the result.

The JavaScript Age Calculator project is a web application designed to calculate a person's age based on their birthdate, implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In the HTML structure, input fields are provided for users to enter their birthdate, along with a button to trigger the age calculation.

CSS styling is utilized to enhance the visual presentation of the calculator, ensuring clarity and ease of use for the user interface. JavaScript serves as the core functionality of the project, handling the computation of the age based on the input birthdate and displaying the result dynamically on the webpage.

Through event listeners and DOM manipulation, users can interact with the age calculator by inputting their birthdate and clicking the calculation button, which triggers JavaScript functions to process the data and compute the age accurately. The result is then displayed in a clear format, typically showing the user's age in years, months, and days.

This project offers an educational experience in JavaScript programming, reinforcing concepts such as date manipulation, mathematical calculations, and dynamic content rendering. Additionally, it demonstrates the practical application of JavaScript in creating useful tools for everyday tasks, making it a valuable exercise for web development enthusiasts.
